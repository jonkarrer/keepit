# Keepit

Simple CLI tool for keeping links.

## Why?

Learning Rust in a project-oriented manner. This project covers some basic concepts of Rust, and I use this tool daily.

## TODO

- [ ] Allow for path to be configured to a user specific markdown location
- [ ] Use a custom message for the commit
- [ ] Express a better Terminal UI for the user input
- [ ] Configure git permissions

## Completed Features

- [x] Read CLI arguments
- [x] Format arguments for markdown write
- [x] Open markdown file to write to, append bytes, create if non existant.
- [x] Push to git when link is added
